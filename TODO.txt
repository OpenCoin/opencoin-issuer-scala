To Dos
======
 * Implement Tests
 * Get rid of *Table classes by using mapped projects: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13906684/scala-slick-method-i-can-not-understand-so-far
 * Combine and appropriately rename MintKey and MintKeyCertificate classes. Same applies for CDD. E.g. CDD, CDDInner, CDDFlat, CDDTable.
 * Now RSA-2048 format is hard-coded. Implement algorithm-independent key format and usage of appropriate cipher-suite.
 * Implement "resume" mechanism
 * Implement error handling and appropriate error messages (for security reasons users shouldn't get very descriptive error messages)
 * Implement certificate revokation mechanism. OCSP kind of style. getAllMintKeyCertificates may only return valid mintkeys. If information service should be used as a revocation service, responds may be need to be signed?
 * Implement authentication and account-integration. Maybe with OAuth?
 * Many more.
 * Implement "Metrics" https://github.com/codahale/metrics
